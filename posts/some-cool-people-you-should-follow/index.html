        <p>﻿Why should you follow people in the first place? Well, no one is forcing you so you don’t have to follow anybody if you don’t want to. But, following people can give you inspiration and great insight on their work. This allows you to gain more knowledge about the potential career paths ahead of you.</p>
<p>I’ll start off with <a href="https://zachholman.com/" class="post-link" target="_blank" rel="external">Zach Holman</a>. He is a web developer and employee number nine at Github. He shows great enthusiasm about his company he is working for and that makes him cool. Holman’s enthusiasm in his talks made me realized how great working for startups can be. Also, that there are people out there who love working for their company. This guy is awesome like many other people I will mention in this post. You should definitely check out his <a href="https://zachholman.com/talks" class="post-link" target="_blank" rel="external">talks</a> as they are one of the best tech talks ever.</p>
<p>Next up is another guy who has a large presence and following. He is <a href="https://addyosmani.com/" class="post-link" target="_blank" rel="external">Addy Osmani</a>. Addy is a Google engineer working with the Chrome team and helps build tools to improve developers like you and me productivity. I’ll take improving productivity any day of the week because I want to get the job done as efficient as possible. Osmani also wrote two books. Both of them are amazing. I recommend reading <a href="https://addyosmani.com/resources/essentialjsdesignpatterns/book/index.html" class="post-link" target="_blank" rel="external">Learning JavaScript Design Patterns</a>, essential to any advanced JavaScript developers.</p>
<p>Up next is <a href="https://github.com/defunkt" class="post-link" target="_blank" rel="external">Chris Wanstrath</a>, the cocreator of Github. That is all I have to say, he is the cocreator of Github for goodness’ sake! Watch his talks as they are awesome. This will be the last Github staff member I going to mention as it will get redundant. Go to Github team page to see all the other amazing staff members.</p>
