        <p>While technology strides toward improvement, some individuals say we will become better than human or even become more human. Most people fear robots taking over their jobs. Some doubt that their job can be taken over by robots, but countless papers and research have proven that robots taking over human jobs is imminent. The most famous video that supports this in recent years is<br>YouTuber CGPGrey’s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Pq-S557XQU" target="_blank" rel="external"><em>Humans Need Not Apply</em></a> in which he discusses that automation is inevitable.<br>Another distinguished video by Vsauce2 called <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsACeAkvFLY" target="_blank" rel="external"><em>Will Robots Make Us More Human?</em></a> in which he states how people work throughout history and he references Studs Terkel book Working, where these workers were interviewed, and the most repeated phrase stated was “I’m a robot”. Since hard labor are better jobs for robots, Kevin Kelly, executive editor of Wired magazine states, “automation created hundreds of millions of jobs in entirely new fields.” Furthermore, Kelly states, “And they will help us discover new jobs for ourselves, new tasks that expand who we are. They will let us focus on becoming more human than we were.” These new jobs are arising as of today, due to the increase advancement of technology. The most prominent is that of the gaming industry and live streaming where millions of people tune in to watch professionals play games like in traditional sports. Live streaming has a practical and beneficial impact on individuals in entertainment and education because it offers a medium that other mediums wasn’t able to offer before, filling the need of consumers, and providing an additional waypoint for students to learn.</p>
<p>The entertainment value provided by live streaming gives individuals with more content of their choosing and fulfills their need of this medium in their lives. Nathan Edge, an undergraduate at Elon university, quotes Emmett Shear, CEO of Twitch TV: “sharing a video game experience is something that the younger generation grew up doing from their couches, and Twitch TV’s service is a natural extension of this gaming experience” (35). Nowadays, more and more people are getting into video games as it is becoming mainstream. The fact that video games are getting popular is supported by a report in the 2008 where its states, “Fully 97% of teens ages 12-17 play computer, web, portable, or console games” (“Teens”). The younger generation grew up with video games and are now older to experience a more enhancing and immersive experience of playing video games and watching live streams of them. People seek out and tune into live streams because of uses and gratifications theory. Edge quotes Bondad-Brown, Rice, and Pearce stating, “Uses and gratification theory ‘stresses individual use and choice in communication behaviors and helps explain how the media and their content can be a source of influence within the context of other competing influences’” (37). This means that what the person picks impacts the decision of external influences. The assumptions made from the statement, describing how individuals are active participants and how the media are competitive with each other to gain the individual’s attention. In summary, Edge quotes Bondad-Brown and others, “At the core of uses and gratification theory are motivations and audience activity” (37). This explains why individuals watch live streams as it fulfills their entertainment value due to motivating factors and their past gratifying media they participated in. In addition, Bondad-Brown and others states, “The use of the Internet as a one-stop convenience outlet for entertainment suggests that online video “combines the instant gratification of TV with the personal control of the Internet” (37). This combination is also why live streaming has become increasing popular with individuals of the younger generation. It fuses together the best of both past times leading to a new and better alternative to traditional broadcasting methods.</p>
<p>Live streaming only became increasing popular due to ease of accessibility. Before this, “video streaming per se was not possible due to the lack of capacities in the infrastructure and the costs of server and technology for streamers” (Scholz 8). Without the proper framework, live streaming would have never been as popular as it is today. But advancements were made in 2009, platforms allow live streaming to be possible, and “these platforms allowed easy access for viewers, integrated chat for interaction between viewers and streamers, generating a revenue stream through commercials and access on mobile phones” (Scholz 8). The live streaming medium available to everyone with a computer and internet collection gave way for the medium to grow. Furthermore, the integrated chat encourage access to a community to be formed through live streaming. This and the rising competitiveness of games allow for a new genre to arise called eSports. It is describe to be, “an area of sport activities in which people develop and train mental or physical abilities in the use of information and communication technologies” (Scholz 5). With accessibility improving, video game users discovering live streaming and streaming of eSports events and tournaments gave rise to the live streaming medium in general. The accumulation of improvements of technology, leading to live streaming and eSports to be popular allow for new jobs to pop up as stated previously of how advancing technology spawn new kinds of jobs. In addition, Edge states, “IPTV has provided an additional medium for income for professional gamers outside of sponsorships and tournaments. This has allowed for individuals to pursue a career in playing video games, an option that did not exist five years ago (38). The live streaming medium gave enough sufficient funds for individuals to sustain a career in video games. However, it is not just playing video games, there is also individuals hosting tournaments for video games and casting them. This is similar to how traditional sports gave way for jobs other the the players themselves. The practical aspect of a possible career in video games and beneficial aspect of fulfilling entertainment value, live streaming has made these possible therefore, allowing and maintaining a positive impact in the individuals involved.</p>
<p>Live streaming gave way for in real time classrooms for students to get associated in. With live streaming, it enables other kinds of ways for learning and teaching. Karen Fill and Roger Ottewill from University of Southampton, states that, “While technological progress and metadata developments offer considerable opportunities for creating, locating and re-using high-quality video streams, taking advantage of their potential to support effective learning requires careful blending with other resources and activities” (406). They mention that video streaming is not good enough for education and needs to be mix effectively with other methods of teaching. But, the opportunity and potential of learning can greatly enhance learning experiences of individuals. More technology is getting more involved in the traditional classrooms and one of those technology is that of live streaming slowly emerging in. Moreover, a report commissioned by Cisco Systems presents, “Students today are increasingly visual-spatial learners, able to multitask and interact with multimedia. While not a panacea for good teaching, video is clearly an essential tool that can have a powerful impact on student retention of information and on student engagement.” The support for the expanding benefits of live streaming allows for students to more smoothly learn due to their mature visual depth. Additionality, it impacts students and learners positivity as it gives them another way to retain and absorb information, improving their motivation to learn.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, some argue against live streaming and advancing technology in general as it is a waste of time or that we are losing something because of it. Nicholas Carr who is a writer that argues in Is Google Making Us Stupid?, “As we are drained of our ‘inner repertory of dense cultural inheritance,’ Foreman concluded, we risk turning into ‘pancake people’—spread wide and thin as we connect with that vast network of information accessed by the mere touch of a button.” This means that we are becoming more engulf in many things and that we would lose ourselves in it. In regards, it depends on the individual at hand and if they have the willpower and knowledge to balance it out in moderation. The analogy of food to this is that both technology and food are essential to our modern lives and that when choosing between healthy food and junk food to eat, individuals with enough wisdom will balance between healthy and junk food for optimal benefit without much of the negatives of just eating only one of either healthy or junk food. This can be related back to technology as you can choose to fully be committed in using all technology, not use it at all, or use it only at certain conveniences and places. In response to being a waste of time as this can be said to many things in life, so it is a matter of opinion. For example, watching eSports can be said to be wasting time as you can play yourselves however, this can be apply to traditional sports as well.</p>
<p>With the awareness of live streaming and its effects on many individual lives, you should go out and experience it yourself. This is because of its uniqueness and communities surrounding live streams paving the way for a grand medium.</p>
