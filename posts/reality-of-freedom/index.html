        <p>The traditional education system has been with us for many centuries, but it is not the only way we can learn. Paulo Freire, an educator and philosopher, coined the term banking concept of education to describe the traditional education system. In Chapter 2 of <em>Pedagogy of the Oppressed</em>, Freire deem the banking concept of education as flawed and that we should change our education system to a problem-posing approach as it provides both teachers and students more freedom and a better overall experience. Problem-posing style of teaching is what I believe to be the most effective because it has real-life applications, does not consciously oppressed us, and is more easily modular to change.</p>
<p>Problem-posing approach to teaching brings people closer to reality. From my personal experience in school, my favorite classes were classes where we build or analyze things that are meaningful. These classes were my computer classes, science classes, and some of my English classes. In my computer classes, we used the tools of the technology to make impressive projects such as a website or a game. In science, we got to build and launch rockets. In one of my English classes, we were reading, analyzing, and discussing the challenging fictional texts. Freire states when regarding problem-posing education, students and teachers are. “…always ‘cognitive,’ whether preparing a project or engaging in dialogue with the students.” In the classes I mentioned both my teachers and my fellow classmates were engaged cognitively, the teacher guiding the students to follow through and understand the task at hand, and the students inspired and critically involved. This relates to bringing us closer to reality by making the student and the teacher do something cognitively active instead of the teacher lecturing and students sitting docilely at their desk. Furthermore, Freire asserts that “Problem-posing education bases itself on creativity and stimulates true reflection and action upon reality, thereby responding to the vocation of persons as beings only when engaged in inquiry and creative transformation.” This means that individuals are truly recognized when engaging in thought-provoking activities. The pair of teacher and students interacting through discussion or activity improves each other development in the ways they perceive the world around them. For example, in my government class where instead of reading the textbooks and memorizing the facts, we model and simulate how congress is run. We created our own bills and we split off into committees where we argued and debated over which of our bills to pass or reject. Our teacher was monitoring and engaging in our debates and giving us feedback on our thoughts. We were reflecting upon ourselves and each other therefore bringing us closer to reality as we notice and question throughout. The problem-posing style of education overcomes many of the shortcomings of the banking concept of education.</p>
<p>Problem-posing education is the practice of freedom unlike the banking concept of education which is the practice of domination. Students are sufferers of narration sickness from the banking concept of education. As Freire elaborates throughout the chapter, “Worse yet, it [banking model] turns them [students] into ‘containers’ to be ‘filled’ by the teacher. The more completely she fills the receptacles, the better a teacher she is. The more meekly the receptacles permit themselves to be filled, the better students they are.” This is like turning the young into a generation of Communists in Soviet Russian schools. In my experience in many classes like math and history classes, the teacher would just keep lecturing for the whole period while we the students have the option to take notes or not. We are passively receiving the information and that is all we can do. We have no choice for interactions or we will be deemed as a bad student or punished for doing so. Students regarded as objects and the teachers as subjects narrating alienating topics. This is described as being boring and dull by Freire. Students will memorize and not truly understand the content, therefore they are losing the ability to think critically such that they are more willing to accept their passive role and stay in their place in the world. The banking concept of education mirrors an oppressive society, keeping the oppress oppressed so therefore the cycle keeps repeating itself. In order to stop this, Freire suggests, “the solution is not to ‘integrate’ them into the structure of oppression, but to transform that structure so that they can become ‘beings for themselves.’” This means to change the style of teachings so they, the students, can recognize the individuality of the human being. Freire mentions that problem-posing education can do this since it responds to the essence of consciousness.</p>
<p>The problem-posing style of teaching is more flexible to change because it does not oppress the individual contrasted to the banking concept of education. The flaws of problem-posing can be more easily overcome due to the fact that individuals can think critically and are more free to express themselves. In addition, Freire states, “Problem-posing education affirms men and women as beings the process of becoming — as unfinished, uncompleted beings in and with a likewise unfinished reality.” Problem-posing education is not a silver bullet to cognition and pedagogical practice and, therefore, can change and evolve like human beings if we push for it to happen. Approaches of problem-posing education value the students more than just mere objects.</p>
<p>In the end, the banking concept has been with us for a long time due to its familiarity and oppressive nature. Its cons outweigh its pros for far too long and we must take action to integrate other styles of teachings into the classroom. This is already happening in the world with the common core curriculum in America. Problem-posing education has solid evidence and results from my experience in being the most effective style in the classroom. This is because it doesn’t hide reality from you and grants students and teachers more freedom to experiment in the classroom. With technology advancing, cons of all styles of teaching can be diminished as the way of teaching can be personalized to be most significant to each individual student.</p>
